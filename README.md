WoofWalk is available for iPhone on the Apple App Store.
WoofWalk is intended for use by veterinarians and dog owners to track their dog's walks. 
WoofWalk will analyze the walks to provide measurements on the dog's performance. 
Once you complete a walk, you will have the option to save the walk to your device. 
You can access your saved walks in the "Past Walks" tab of the app.
If you notice a steady decrease in your dog's performance, this may be a potential sign of muscle atrophy.

More information about WoofWalk is available in the "About WoofWalk" tab of the app.

In some cases, WoofWalk may be unable to immediately pinpoint the user's location. In the case that WoofWalk takes upwards of 10 seconds to find your location, please follow these guidelines:
1. Select the start a new walk option in the app, and start the walk.
2. Wait for the app to find your location. This may take upwards of 10 seconds but should take no longer than 30 seconds.
3. Once the app finds your location, end and discard the walk. Now you can start a new walk and the app should be able to pinpoint your location almost immediately.
